The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic based on features such as passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, fare, and port of embarkation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Explanation of the Code:**\n\nImport Libraries: The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, and TensorFlow for building neural networks.\n\nLoad the Dataset: The training and test datasets are loaded into pandas DataFrame objects from CSV files using pd.read_csv().\n\nData Preprocessing: The preprocess_data() function is defined to handle missing values and convert categorical variables into numerical form. It fills missing values for age, fare, and embarked port with median and mode values, respectively. It also maps categorical variables like sex and embarked port to numerical values.\n\nFeature Selection: The relevant features are selected for training the models. These features are stored in the features list.\n\nSplit the Dataset: The training dataset is split into training and validation sets using train_test_split() from scikit-learn.\n\nStandardize the Features: The features are standardized using StandardScaler() to ensure that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A KNN classifier is trained on the standardized training data using KNeighborsClassifier(). The number of neighbors is set to 5 by default. The model is then evaluated on the validation set using accuracy_score().\n\nNeural Network (Deep Learning): A simple neural network model is defined using Sequential() from TensorFlow's Keras API. The model consists of multiple dense layers with ReLU activation functions and a dropout layer to prevent overfitting. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. It is trained on the standardized training data and evaluated on the validation set.\n\nMake Predictions: The KNN model is used to make predictions on the test dataset.\n\nPrepare Submission File: The predictions are stored in a DataFrame along with passenger IDs and saved to a CSV file in the required format for submission.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np #

Both KNN and Neural Networks demonstrated their effectiveness in capturing complex patterns in the data and making accurate predictions.\n\nDespite the success of our models, we encountered challenges in handling missing data and optimizing model parameters. However, by experimenting with different techniques and fine-tuning our approach, we were able to mitigate these challenges and achieve satisfactory results.\n\nLooking forward, there are opportunities to further improve our models by exploring ensemble methods, feature selection techniques, and more advanced neural network architectures. Additionally, extending our analysis to other datasets or real-world scenarios could provide valuable insights into disaster preparedness and emergency response strategies.","metadata":{}}]}
